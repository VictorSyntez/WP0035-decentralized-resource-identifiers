## Summary

Research objects (e.g., authors, samples, equipment, and datasets) need digital identifiers that are persistent, unique, and globally resolvable to enable a host of benefits in the research ecosystem. The current organization of these digital identifiers means that for each new class of identifier there is de novo creation of the requisite supporting identifier system. We propose to outline an ecosystem of Decentralized Resource Identifiers (DRIs), compatible with existing identifiers but offering numerous benefits including decentralization, interoperability, and security. The DRI ecosystem would consist of the technology infrastructure and related tools such as guiding principles, governance examples, semantics, training, documentation.
